            "content":"Our Digital Parenting resources are tools that have been conceived and designed to reach parents through digital formats such as online and/or mobile applications, texting and chat services.   ParentChat Due to the impact of COVID-19, it is more challenging for in-person parenting programmes to reach families in need. ParentChat is a newly developed online version of the Parenting for Lifelong Health programmes for young children and adolescents, which will be delivered through online messaging services such as WhatsApp or Viber. The programme aims to improve parent-child relationships and child well-being, reduce child maltreatment and to increase the availability of parenting programmes for vulnerable families.   The programme will run for 8 weeks and is available for parents who have children between the ages of 2 to 17. Each week of the programme includes 2 chat sessions, each lasting one hour, with a trained facilitator who will guide parents through evidence-based parenting tips and activities. In these chat sessions, facilitators will discuss ways to strengthen the parent-child relationship through group conversation, activities and storytelling, covering themes including:   Relationship building through one-on-one time with your children (e.g., quality time, talking about emotions, taking a pause) Positive reinforcement of positive behaviour (e.g., praise, giving clear and positive instructions, establishing routines and rules) Coping with difficulties (e.g., positive discipline, managing difficult child behaviour, handling crises)  Additional content will be provided for children with disabilities.   Parents will be encouraged to give regular feedback regarding successes and challenges applying these parenting skills in the online group chat. The facilitator will then provide a brief summary of the feedback and address possible solutions to 2-3 key challenges. Throughout the week the facilitator will also provide interactive learning experiences through helpful tips, fun activities, and reminders, to help parents develop and apply the skills they have learnt across the entire programme.   ParentChat is currently being prepared for delivery in six countries; Malaysia, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Philippines, and South Africa.   Reach A pilot study of the programme will test the initial feasibility and impact of ParentChat with 900 families in 2021 before wider release.   Partnerships with countries: ParentChat has been developed in collaboration with the following research partners.   For more information on ParentChat click here   Universiti Putra Malaysia (Malaysia) Health for Youth Association (Moldova) UNICEF Montenegro (Montenegro) Alternativa (North Macedonia) Ateneo de Manila University (Philippines) University of Cape Town (South Africa) University of Oxford (United Kingdom) The programme will be delivered in collaboration with local government and non-governmental organisations. The University of Cape Town will be partnering with Clowns without Borders, the Department of Social Development and Mothers2Mothers for delivery in South Africa. Researchers at Ateneo de Manila University are planning dissemination with the Department of Social Welfare and Development in the Philippines. ParentChat will be delivered by The National Population and Family Development Board at the Ministry of Women, Family, and Community Development in Malaysia, with support from Universiti Putra Malaysia. The remaining partners; Alternativa in North Macedonia, Health for Youth Association in Moldova and UNICEF in Montenegro, will each deliver ParentChat in their respective country.

Data on the number of beneficiaries who received the COVID-19 parenting resources is collected using social media metrics, Google analytics, reports from implementing agencies, surveys with organisations, and direct distribution. We also sent a short survey to over 600 implementing partners in approximately 187 countries who reported on the reach, adoption, and implementation of the resources.  The overall reach is calculated by summing the total number of beneficiaries who receive the resources from each implementing partner regardless of implementation strategy. In order to avoid potential double counting, we use a conservative method to estimate the reach of social media platforms in alignment with technical guidance for supporting digital platforms and traditional media from UNICEF Risk Communication and Community Engagement COVID-19 Global Response. As a result, only one social media platform per implementing agency or data source was included in analyses, based on the platform with the highest reach.
